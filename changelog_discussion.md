Starting a changelog discussion from here.

I have worked and discussed solutions and procedures about this project previously, but staged very few changes and didn't keep track of the discussions (some were written on paper and then thrown away). Luckily, there are some notes written through the code specific for said parts, which I will move here.

The intent is to write down and keep said discussions for a better understanding of the development of this project.
